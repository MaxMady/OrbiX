# Orbix

Orbix is a 2D physics engine built in Node.js for simulating the movements of celestial bodies like planets and satellites in space.

## Features

- Accurate 2D physics simulation
- Customizable celestial bodies with mass, initial velocity, and position
- Integration of gravitational forces
- Support for various time steps to control simulation precision
- Basic collision handling for elastic collisions
- Visualization tools to observe the simulated orbits

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```

```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Customize the simulation parameters in the `config.js` file.
2. Implement your desired celestial bodies and their initial conditions in the `main.js` file.
3. Run the simulation:
```
node .
```
